# cursed-live
This is sample website i designed in my second year of college. The back end main controller, repositories, database and page logic is scripted in PHP, with the page access control and design being a combination of HTML and TWIG.

The content is based off the Harry Potter stage show "The cursed Child" and i dont claim any of the rights to any of the content, only the code. The database is a MYSQL database with a simple php script to fire up the database on the inital execution of the site.

The session and user management is hard coded, due to time contraints at the project completion stage. I intend to return to this project and replace that with database stored sessions ID's and username/password controls. The passwords however are database stored hashed.

I was not a fan initially wof working with PHP but over the course of this project it grew on me and the addition of twig templating made page layout design fun and dynamic.
